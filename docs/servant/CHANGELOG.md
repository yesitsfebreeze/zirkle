# CHANGELOG

## 2025-07-30 — fast orbital + hard bubble

- ROT 0.06→0.9 rad/s: fast gravitational orbit, ~7s per lap
- Spring 20→140: stiff binding, circle stays tight at speed
- Damping 6→10: critical at high spring, no ringing
- SEP_R 3.5→6.0, weight 80→180: wider evasion at high traffic
- Bubble: hard elastic bounce (particles ricochet, cannot enter)
- Bubble radius: log-scaled (`60+80·log(1+dist/R)`), grows with cursor distance
- Cursor circle: positioned halfway between mouse and ring center

## 2025-07-30 — autopilot bootstrap

- Created docs/ structure: prd/, specs/, autopilot/, servant/
- Wrote VISION, FEATURES, CHANGELOG
- Armed PRD reconcile watch on docs/prd.md + docs/prd/
